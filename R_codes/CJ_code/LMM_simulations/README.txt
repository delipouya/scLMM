Please find attached my code and figures for the simulation analysis about the performance of the REML algorithms.
R code: 
simulate.covar.geno.R: generating design matrices for fixed effects and random effects
reml.R: REML with three iterative algorithms (only for small data, e.g., n < 2000)
simuLMM-reml.R: two types of simulations: 1) compare the three iterative algorithms; 2) 100 repeating simulations.
